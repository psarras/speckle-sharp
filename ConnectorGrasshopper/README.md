## Introduction

This repo holds Speckle's Grasshopper Connector and it is currently released as âš  **BETA** âš , please use at your own risk!

The connector is structured in 1 c# project:

- ConnectorGrasshopper: contains the grasshopper component nodes and parameters.

## Documentation

Comprehensive developer and user documentation can be found in our:

#### ðŸ“š [Speckle Docs website](https://speckle.guide/dev/)

## Developing & Debugging

We encourage everyone interested to debug / hack / contribute / give feedback to this project.

### Requirements

- Rhino 6 or above (we're currently testing with 6.28)
- A Speckle Server running (more on this below)
- Speckle Manager (more on this below)

### Getting Started

Following instructions on how to get started debugging and contributing to this connector.

#### Dependencies

All dependencies exist either on this repo (such as `Core`, `Objects`, etc...) or are installed via NuGet. 

Worth mentioning is the use of our own asyncronous grasshopper component, which you can find here:

- https://github.com/specklesystems/GrasshopperAsyncComponent

We also make use of the following `dotnet tools` in this project:

- https://github.com/mono/t4

These are declared on the manifest file `.config/dotnet-tools.json`. To install them in your computer just run the following command on your terminal:

```
dotnet tools restore
```

#### Server

In order to test Speckle in all its glory you'll need a server running, you can run a local one by simply following these instructions:

- https://github.com/specklesystems/Server

If you're facing any errors make sure Postgress and Redis are up and running.

#### Accounts

The connector itself doesn't have features to manage your Speckle accounts, this functionality has been delegated to the Speckle Manager desktop app.

You can install an alpha version of it from: https://speckle-releases.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/manager/SpeckleManager%20Setup.exe

After installing it, you can use it to add/create an account on the Server.

### Debugging

After setting up dependencies, server and accounts you're good to go. Just make sure of the following:

- the Solution builds fine in your IDE

- you IDE is set to start the correct version of Rhino on Debug

- your Post-Build event is set up correctly to rename the project `.dll` to `.gha`.

The first time you run Rhino after having built the project, you need to add the `bin\` folder in the `GrasshopperConnector` project to the _Library Folders_ in the _Grasshopper Developer Settings_. To do that, follow these steps.

- Execute the command `GrasshopperDeveloperSettings` in Rhino.

- Click on the `Add folder` button.

- Click on the `...` button on the new empty line that appeared below.

- Select the `bin\` folder in your project and click ok.

- In order to hit breakpoints in your code, it's important to **deactivate** the option `Memory load assemblies using COFF byte arrays`.

And voila', once you start Grasshopper, the `Speckle 2` tab should now appear along any other Grasshopper plugins you may have installed.

> If Grasshopper was already running, you may need to restart Rhino for the Speckle plugin to load.
